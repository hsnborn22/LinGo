# Contributing guidelines

If you reached this page, I thank you in advance for your interest in the project, as well as the potential amount of work that you're willing to put in it. As I made clear in other documentation files of the project, all help to the project
(which can come in a manifold of ways) is greatly appreciated. Contributing is not only writing new code or fixing bugs:
helping to write the documentation, providing a translation to a certain piece of documentation or even sponsoring the project are all contributions which are very important for the project.

## How to contribute?

In this section, I will cover how to contribute to the project specifically in terms of code-based contributions. Let's suppose that you have found a bug; how can you communicate it?
First, start by looking at the issues tab and see if there is already someone who found your same bug; if the answer is affirmative, you can contribute and maybe figure out a solution there.
If not, you can create an issue tab yourself (I have included some pre-made issue templates for easier use, but you can make one manually yourself). In the issues tab, you will be able to communicate
with the whole community that is working on the project, as well as the owner of the repo. The code that will then be pushed will have to be  


To make a contribution, you need to fork the repo; this means that the repo will be copied in your github profile, and from there you will be able to change the code and improve it. Before making a pull request to the original repo (this one) remember to open a tab in the issues panel and discuss the changes that you want to make, not only with the repo owner, but also with the community, in order to see how they are received.

Also before contributing, make sure that both the code you added, the issues you opened and the comments on the pull requests you made are made according to the code of conduct of the project (in short, just try to be polite, thorough in your explanations and open to discussion).

With this said,

Happy contributing!
