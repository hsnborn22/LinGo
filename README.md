# LinGo
LinGo is a terminal based language aquisiton application, which allows you to learn languages while reading texts. The application allows you to load texts, read them, mark words with different colors based on your knowledge of them, listen the pronunciation of words on the spot and get a translation of each word without leaving the application; all the words you marked will then be saved locally on your machine and can be easily imported into anki or memrise flashcards. The application is entirely keyboard-based, making it way faster to use compared to the other alternatives. 

Below some tests to show how the application works.

## Motivation:
The motivation for the application comes from multiple sources; on a conceptual level, the application is based on the technique of language aquisition via text, a technique which is deemed to be highly effective by many linguists and polyglots. However, when you read a text in a language you're still learning, new words that you don't know and you don't know the pronunciation of are quite common: these occurences force you to move your attention away from the text, go to an online (or physical) dictionary, look up the meaning of the word, listen to its pronunciation exc. With this application (which really started out as a tool for myself) you can do all of this without moving away from the text you're reading, making the process of learning by aquisition faster, easier and more enjoyable.

Another necessity which we could encounter frequently is that of remembering these new words we encountered and then maybe inserting them in some flashcard system in order to master them.  
Let's envision this process if we had to absorb a language by reading physical books via an "algorithmic" procedure:

Reading --> encounter new word --> look up meaning and pronunciation elsewhere --> sign on the physical book that we do not know this word (for example by underlining it --> when we are done with our reading session, find all those words and manually make them into an anki or memrise flashcard set.

Wow, it takes really a lot of time! Well, I have good news for you: this application automates all of this for you. While you're reading, you can mark a word as known by pressing the key "3" (and the app will mark it as green), as semi-known by pressing the key "2" (and the app will mark the word as yellow) and as not known by pressing the key "1" (and the app will mark the word as red). By pressing the key 0 you can decide to ignore a word (by default, if you never encountered a word before, the value is set to 0 so you can decide if you know it or not).
