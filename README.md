# LinGo
LinGo is a terminal based language aquisiton application, which allows you to learn languages while reading texts. The application allows you to load texts, read them, mark words with different colors based on your knowledge of them, listen the pronunciation of words on the spot and get a translation of each word without leaving the application; all the words you marked will then be saved locally on your machine and can be easily imported into anki or memrise flashcards. The application is entirely keyboard-based, making it way faster to use compared to the other alternatives. 

Below some tests to show how the application works.
